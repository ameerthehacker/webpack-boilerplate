## Assets

### JavaScript

* All JavaScript assets should be in the directory __src/js__
* ECMA Script 6 is supported using __babel__ and should be strictly followed
* Linting is provided by __eslint__
* All external JavaScript dependencies should be installed with __npm__ only
* __Vue__ is installed and imported in __src/js/app.js__

npm run dev
```

* Lint the JavaScript code

```
npm run lint
```

* Run unit testing with __jest__
